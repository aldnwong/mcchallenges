# MC Challenges
MC Challenges is a 1.20/1.20.1 datapack I originally created for my friends. I wanted to try some of the "Minecraft, but.." concepts I've seen on Youtube with friends, and this datapack is the result of that.
It contains different challenges:
- Lives System
    - System includes two different events that allow players to gain lives
- TNT Spawns
- Wither Spawns
- Random Potion Effects
- Two Player Swap

All challenges can be easily toggled in a chat menu that can be found with `/function challenges:menu`.
